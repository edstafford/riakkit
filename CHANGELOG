A backward incompatible release of riakkit.

This version is a rewrite of the previous versions to make the code more
manageable. On top, it should be faster, though it's still quite slow.

Main focus of this release is:

 - Rewriting the base for consistencies.
 - Introduced SimpleDocuments, BaseDocuments. These serves as lower level
   abstractions.
 - Introduced load on demand for reference properties as well as `getRawData`.
   This means that riakkit won't start a dominoe effect of loading objects from
   the db
 - Loads of unittests are written to prevent regressions. More are welcomed!
 - Introduced SetProperty, PasswordProperty. A note: PasswordProperty uses
   bcrypt if there is one, otherwise it falls back to sha256, giving you a
   warning. bcrypt decreases speed significantly, but security increases with it
   as well.

I don't really remember all the stuff, but you can take a look through the
commit logs. I try to explain everything.

This version is actively used in another project of mine. It's a fairly large
scale project. So I can see problems with the current riakkit model (esp. with
all the automations in the `Document` section). If you have any ideas on how to
improve performance. Let me know and fork this project!

Cheers.
